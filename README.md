strava-rs
=========

Strava API client written in rust

## About

This library is highly incomplete. At this point in time, you are able to fetch
the athlete associated with an auth token. See the [athlete
tests](https://github.com/jwilm/strava-rs/blob/master/src/resources/athlete.rs#L101-L105)
for guidance.

Now that APIs are starting to come together, docs will be coming soon.

## Disclaimer

I am not in any way affiliated with Strava, Inc. I merely wish to use the Strava
API from Rust.
